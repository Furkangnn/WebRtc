WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a set of open-source technologies that enables real-time communication capabilities directly within web browsers and mobile applications. It allows developers to build applications that support peer-to-peer communication without requiring intermediary servers for transmitting data (though signaling servers are typically needed to establish connections). Here's what WebRTC can do:

1. Audio and Video Streaming
Real-Time Audio/Video Calls: Enable users to make audio and video calls directly from their browsers or apps.
Low Latency Streaming: Stream audio and video with minimal delay, making it ideal for live interactions.
2. Data Sharing
Peer-to-Peer Data Transfer: Share files or custom data directly between users without uploading to a server.
Efficient Data Streams: Use DataChannels for real-time messaging, gaming, or syncing applications.
3. Interoperability Across Platforms
WebRTC works seamlessly across different platforms (web browsers, desktop, and mobile applications) and devices.
